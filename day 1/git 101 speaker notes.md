**Text for Slide:**  
**Workshop: Git and GitHub Basics for Beginners**

-   Learn to create and manage repositories.
-   Understand Git and GitHub essentials.
-   Practice collaboration.

**Speaker Notes:**

-   "Welcome, everyone, to our workshop on Git and GitHub basics! My name is [Your Name], and I’ll be your guide today."
-   "In this session, we’ll go over essential Git and GitHub concepts and practice using them step by step."
-   "By the end of this workshop, you’ll know how to create repositories, track changes in your code, and collaborate effectively using GitHub. Let’s get started!"

----------

#### **Slide 2: What is Version Control?**

**Text for Slide:**

-   Tracks changes in your project.
-   Prevents accidental data loss.
-   Enables team collaboration without conflicts.

**Speaker Notes:**

-   "Version control is an essential tool in software development. Think of it as a system that keeps a detailed history of your project, helping you track changes over time."
-   "It prevents accidental data loss by allowing you to revert to previous versions if something goes wrong."
-   "For teams, version control eliminates conflicts by tracking who made which changes and ensuring everyone’s work integrates smoothly."

----------

#### **Slide 3: What is Git?**

**Text for Slide:**

-   Free, open-source version control system.
-   Tracks and manages changes in your files.
-   Revert, review, and collaborate easily.

**Speaker Notes:**

-   "Git is a free tool that runs on your local machine. It keeps track of all changes made to your files and allows you to undo, review, or share those changes as needed."
-   "It’s widely used in software development because of its flexibility and speed."
-   "Git also makes collaboration much easier by allowing multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work."

----------

#### **Slide 4: What is GitHub?**

**Text for Slide:**

-   A cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories.
-   Share projects and collaborate online.
-   Showcase your work to the community.

**Speaker Notes:**

-   "GitHub is a platform where you can host your Git repositories online, making them accessible to others for collaboration or review."
-   "It’s also a great way to showcase your work to potential employers or the developer community."
-   "While Git works on your computer, GitHub is like a central hub where you can sync and share your work."

----------

#### **Slide 5: Key Git Commands**

**Text for Slide:**

-   `git init` — Initialize a repository.
-   `git add` — Stage changes.
-   `git commit` — Save changes.
-   `git status` — Check repository status.
-   `git log` — View commit history.

**Speaker Notes:**

-   "These are the core Git commands you’ll use in almost every project."
-   "Let me briefly explain:
    -   `git init` creates a new repository in your project folder.
    -   `git add` stages your changes, making them ready for a commit.
    -   `git commit` saves those staged changes with a message describing what you did.
    -   `git status` shows you the current state of your repository.
    -   `git log` lets you see the history of all commits made so far."
-   "Don’t worry—we’ll practice each of these shortly."

----------

#### **Slide 6: How Git and GitHub Work Together**

**Text for Slide:**

-   Git works locally.
-   GitHub stores your code online.
-   Use `git push` and `git pull` to sync changes.

**Speaker Notes:**

-   "Git is your local tool for managing changes, and GitHub is where you store and share those changes online."
-   "You use commands like `git push` to upload your changes to GitHub and `git pull` to download changes made by others."
-   "This makes GitHub a powerful collaboration platform, especially for remote teams."

----------

#### **Slide 7: Setting Up Git**

**Text for Slide:**

1.  Install Git (if needed).
2.  Configure your user details:
    
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"  
    git config --global user.email "Your Email"  
    
    ```
    
3.  Create a GitHub account.

**Speaker Notes:**

-   "Before you can start using Git, you need to set it up on your computer. If you haven’t installed it yet, you can download it from git-scm.com."
-   "Next, configure Git with your name and email address using the commands on the slide. These details will appear in the commit history and identify your contributions."
-   "If you don’t already have a GitHub account, go ahead and create one now."

----------

#### **Slide 8: Creating Your First Repository**

**Text for Slide:**

1.  Create a folder and initialize Git:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir my-first-repo  
    cd my-first-repo  
    git init  
    
    ```
    
2.  Add a `README.md` file and commit it:
    
    ```bash
    git add README.md  
    git commit -m "Initial commit"  
    
    ```
    

**Speaker Notes:**

-   "Let’s create your first Git repository. Start by creating a folder for your project and navigating to it in the terminal."
-   "Run `git init` to initialize a new repository. This sets up Git tracking for the folder."
-   "Now, create a simple `README.md` file. This file typically contains an introduction to your project."
-   "Finally, use `git add` to stage the file and `git commit` to save it to the repository."

----------

#### **Slide 9: Connecting to GitHub**

**Text for Slide:**

1.  Create a remote repository on GitHub.
2.  Connect the local repository:
    
    ```bash
    git remote add origin <URL>  
    git branch -M main  
    git push -u origin main  
    
    ```
    

**Speaker Notes:**

-   "Next, we’ll link your local repository to GitHub. Start by creating a new repository on GitHub. You can name it the same as your local folder."
-   "Copy the repository URL from GitHub and use the command `git remote add origin <URL>` to connect your local repo."
-   "Run `git push` to upload your files to GitHub. This makes your work available online."

----------

#### **Slide 10: Collaboration Practice**

**Text for Slide:**

1.  One person edits and pushes changes.
2.  Another person clones the repository.
3.  Practice resolving merge conflicts.

**Speaker Notes:**

-   "Now, let’s practice collaboration. Pair up with someone for this activity."
-   "One person will edit the `README.md` file, commit the changes, and push them to GitHub."
-   "The second person will clone the repository, make their own changes, and push them back."
-   "If there’s a conflict, we’ll resolve it together step by step."

----------

#### **Slide 11: Recap and Next Steps**

**Text for Slide:**

-   Commands covered:
    -   `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`.
-   Next steps:
    -   Explore branching (`git branch`, `git merge`).
    -   Try pull requests on GitHub.

**Speaker Notes:**

-   "We’ve covered the basics of Git and GitHub, including setting up repositories, committing changes, and collaborating."
-   "For your next steps, explore branching. This allows you to work on new features without affecting the main codebase."
-   "Pull requests are another great GitHub feature for reviewing and merging changes from team members."
-   "Practice is key—try using Git in your next project!"
